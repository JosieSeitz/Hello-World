# Hello-World 🌍

## **Project Title**
Sample Hello World GitHub.
## **Description**
I am practicing using GitHub for BAIS Professional Preparation class. GitHub is a great way to collaborate with others. While trying to figure out how to use GitHub, I have learned how to stylize my text. Some of the important ones I learned about were **bolding**, *italicizing*, <ins>underlinging</ins>, and ~strikethrough~. I have also learned how to add a URL link connected to text. This was my first time using a platform like this, so it has been a big learning experience for me.
